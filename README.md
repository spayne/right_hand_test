# ![](right_hand_test/resources/icons/right_controller_status_ready.png) OpenVR Device Driver: Right Hand Test

This is a minimal OpenVR driver that publishes a controller with an animating skeleton on the right hand. 

It is as correct and as small as possible. If you can make it more correct, please let me know! 

## Introduction
